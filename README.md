Millennium is an **open-source low-code modding framework** to create, manage and use themes/plugins<br/> for the desktop Steam Client without any low-level internal interaction or overhead.

## This is my personal fork with failsafes removed. The approach here is deemed insecure by the original developer. There will be no support provided for it.
